## Goal
- Have a working version of Atari's Super Breakout
- Fully finish the game with music and sound effects
  - Made by me!
- Find the *fun*!

### What is currently working
- The core gameplay loop is in place
  - Player can win by breaking out of the final red layer, and passing through
  - Player can lose by missing the ball with the paddle too many times
  - Player can pause the game by pressing the 'esc' key
  - Player can move the paddle back and forth

### What I'm planning on implementing
- Sound effects
- Music
- Settings Menu
- Main Menu background art
- In game background art
- Custom loading screen for BitMage Studios
